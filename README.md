# 💊 Medicine Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
The **Medicine Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based web application that provides **personalized medicine suggestions** based on patient symptoms, medical history, and other attributes.  
It aims to assist doctors, patients, and healthcare professionals in making data-driven treatment decisions while reducing prescription errors and improving accessibility to basic healthcare.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Recommend appropriate medicines based on symptoms and patient data.  
- Improve healthcare accessibility, especially in remote areas.  
- Reduce human error in prescriptions and diagnosis.  
- Provide additional health insights like **diet**, **workouts**, and **precautions**.  
- Integrate potential features for **real-time doctor consultations**.
